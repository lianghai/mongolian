# Web-based draft UTN

This is the source repo of [mongolian.lianghai.io](https://mongolian.lianghai.io).

Developed with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev). Automatically deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/changelog/sveltekit-projects-can-now-be-deployed-with-zero-configuration) from the [main](https://github.com/lianghai/mongolian/tree/main) branch.

## Developing

Once youâ€™ve installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server locally and open the site in your browser:

```console
npm run dev -- --open
```

The site auto-reloads when you save changes.
